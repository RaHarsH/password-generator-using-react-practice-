Simple Password Generator


This project is a Simple Password Generator built using React. The application allows users to generate secure, random passwords with customizable options such as length, inclusion of numbers, symbols, and uppercase/lowercase letters. It serves as a practical exercise to reinforce key React concepts and hooks.

Key Concepts Learned


1. useEffect Hook:

The useEffect hook is used to manage side effects in React components. In this project, it ensures that the password is updated whenever the user changes any input criteria, such as password length or character types. This hook is essential for synchronizing the component's state with user interactions, making the application more responsive and dynamic.

2. useCallback Hook:

The useCallback hook is employed to optimize the performance of the application by memoizing the password generation function. This prevents unnecessary re-creations of the function during re-renders, particularly when the function doesn't depend on frequently changing values. This optimization is crucial for enhancing the efficiency of the application, especially in scenarios where the function could be computationally intensive.

3. useRef Hook:

The useRef hook allows the project to persist values between renders without triggering re-renders. In this application, useRef is used to reference the generated password and handle actions like copying it to the clipboard. Additionally, it can be used to manage focus for input elements, improving user experience by making interactions smoother and more intuitive.
